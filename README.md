## 🐾 About Me
- 👩‍⚕️ **Name:** Pate (yes, like the fancy dish—very sophisticated)
- 🏥 **Occupation:** Full-time **ICU Nurse Cat**—saving lives by day, stealing tuna by night
- 🍣 **Hobbies:** Tuna canned, beef grilled, morning terrace strolls, and long naps on keyboards

## 💉 Interests
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** (currently training models *and* humans)
- ❤️ **Healthcare** (because saving lives isn’t just for humans)
- 👨‍💻 **Coding** (mostly with paws, occasional tail interference)

## 😸 Fun Facts
- Expert in **Cattificial Intelligence** and **Paw-gramming**
- Can calculate medication doses *and* the optimal number of naps per day
- Once tried to diagnose the WiFi router because it was “acting sick”

## 🚀 Current Goals
- Master **Reinforcement Learning** (with positive reinforcement = more snacks)
- Explore AI applications in **Healthcare**
- Finally type `pip install tuna` without hitting caps lock
